## About
**Consulta Cep** is an application that searches "Zip code" (Cep) in Brazil using an API.
<p>An ajax object was created using <b>XMLHttpRequest)()</b>
<p>We can either get the response in <b>XML</b> or <b>JSON.</b></p>

<p>I worked with <b>JSON</b>, then, manipulated the data and fed it into the application.</p>
<p>Validations were applied in case data is not found.</p>
